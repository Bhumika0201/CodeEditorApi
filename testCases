TEST PROGRAMS
1. C# Geanerating Fibonacci series
using System;  
  public class FibonacciExample  
   {  
     public static void Main(string[] args)  
      {  
         int n1=0,n2=1,n3,i,number;    
         Console.Write("Fibonacci of 15 Numbers : ");    
         number = 15;  
         Console.Write(n1+" "+n2+" "); //printing 0 and 1    
         for(i=2;i<number;++i) //loop starts from 2 because 0 and 1 are already printed    
         {    
          n3=n1+n2;    
          Console.Write(n3+" ");    
          n1=n2;    
          n2=n3;    
         }

2. # Python Program to find the area of triangle

a = 5
b = 6
c = 7

# Uncomment below to take inputs from the user
# a = float(input('Enter first side: '))
# b = float(input('Enter second side: '))
# c = float(input('Enter third side: '))

# calculate the semi-perimeter
s = (a + b + c) / 2

# calculate the area
area = (s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c)) ** 0.5
print('The area of the triangle is %0.2f' %area)

3. Ruby program for printing data in array

array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for i in array
    puts i
end

4. java program to swap two numbers
import java.util.Scanner;
public class JavaExample 
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        int num1, num2;
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        num1 =5;
        num2 =10;
        /* To make you understand, lets assume I am going
         * to enter value of first number as 10 and second 
         * as 5. Binary equivalent of 10 is 1010 and 5 is
         * 0101
         */
        
        //num1 becomes 1111 = 15
        num1 = num1 ^ num2;
        //num2 becomes 1010 = 10
        num2 = num1 ^ num2;
        //num1 becomes 0101 = 5
        num1 = num1 ^ num2;
        scanner.close();
        System.out.println("The First number after swapping:"+num1);
        System.out.println("The Second number after swapping:"+num2);
    }
}
